  <div class="title">How Decentralisation and Web3 can beat inflation ?</div>
  <div class="text">
    The world is changing and thus is the money around us also. And in this
    fast-moving world, we are being slowed down due to increasing inflation.
    Prices of crude oil are rising due to which gas is becoming expensive, this
    is leading to more cost spent on transporting raw and finished goods, thus
    either the price of goods is increasing or the volume/quantity is
    decreasing. This is also called Skimpflation. But the demand remains the
    same. So why is inflation occurring, why are the goods becoming so
    expensive? One of the primitive reasons is the lockdown due to Covid-19 when
    the lockdown happened many people lost their jobs, many people were stuck in
    expensive cities which lead to the draining of their savings, and due to
    which government had to provide many facilities like ambulances, free covid
    testing, food for poor and there was no income or exchange of money during
    this time. The economy was down. But the main effect of covid was yet to
    come ..................
